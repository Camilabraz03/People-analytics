<!-- # People-analytics

People analytics is the analysis of people data with scientific methods in order to make the decisions regarding employees in a company more assertive. This approach combines the expertise of several areas of human knowledge – organizational psychology, applied statistics, human resources processes, data science, etc. – to increase the level of criticality of these decisions and minimize the effects of arbitrary judgments typically made when human beings analyze other human beings.
